You are given a weekly allowance of N2,000. Your job is to use Python assignment operators to simulate how you spend and manage your money throughout the week. 
Instructions: 
Write a Python program that performs the following steps and prints the allowance after each one: 
1.	You spent N400 on books
2.	You found N100 under your bed and added it to your allowance
3.	You bought snacks worth N250
4.	You gave 25% of your current allowance to your younger sibling 
5.	You used one-third of whatâ€™s left to buy data
6.	You split the remaining balance equally between savings and tithing.
7.	Finally, calculate what remains after removing all complete N100 notes using the modulus assignment operator (%=).
